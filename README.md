## Description

The complete web development bootcamp was created by Angela Yu. I'm following the course on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/. The course offers lessons
on full stack development. The course covers topics on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Document Object Model (DOM), jQuery, 
the Unix command line, Node.js, Express.js, Git and version control, APIs, EJS, SQL, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Also, this course
has various challenges and projects along the way. The objective is to complete the course, and as I progress, complete each 
project along the way. Upon completion, I will earn my certification of full stack development.
