<h1>this is a level one heading using the "h1" tag</h1>
<h2>this is a level two heading using the "h2" tag</h2>
<h3>this is a level three heading using the "h3" tag</h3>
<h4>this is a level four heading using the "h4" tag</h4>
<h5>this is a level five heading using the "h5" tag</h5>
<h6>this is a level six heading using the "h6" tag</h6>

<p>&ltbr&gt tag is used to create line breaks in between html elements.</p>

<p>&lthr&gt tag is used for header rows, this creates simple line borders.</p>

<p>HTML attributes are used to modify the HTML elements, for example, you could
  change color, size, etc. These are placed just after the starting HTML tag and
  between the tag type and the greater than symbol.</p>

<!-- this is a comment in html -->

<p>&lt!DOCTYPE&gt tells the browser which version of HTML we are using</p>

<p>The &lthead&gt tag holds information about the page and tells the browser how
  it should handle the page.</p>

<p>The &lttitle&gt tag tells the title of the particular page.</p>

<p>The &ltmeta&gt tag gives extra meta data or associated data to the document</p>

<p>The "charset='utf-8'" is an attribute that tells the browser that anything
  written in the body is encoded using the 'UTF-8' encoding system. 'UTF-8' is the
  standard encoding when working with HTML5. The reason for using this encoding system
  is because it uses all of the international symbols including other characters such as
  emojis.</p>

<hr>
when using an &ltul&gt (unordered) or &ltol&gt (ordered list) and you're looking to add additional information to
the &ltli&gt list items, you could nest those items. In order to nest the items, you would have
to include an additional &ltul&gt or &ltol&gt tag after your list item and before your closing tag.
An example would be:<br>
<pre>
&ltul&gt

  &ltli&gtFirst example
    &ltul&gt
      &ltli&gt sub info on first example&lt/li&gt
    &lt/ul&gt
  &lt/li&gt

&lt/ul&gt
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>First Example
    <ul>
      <li>sub info on first example</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Example
    <ul>
      <li>sub info on this example</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

When using tables you can create two columns of data within a table by nesting tables.
The tables can be nested within the table data tags. For example:
<pre>
  <code>
    &lttable&gt

      &lttr&gt

        &lttd&gt

          &lttable&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the first set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the second set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

          &lt/table&gt

        &lt/td&gt

        &lttd&gt

          &lttable&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the third set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the fourth set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

          &lt/table&gt

        &lt/td&gt

      &lt/tr&gt

    &lt/table&gt
  </code>
</pre>

this example would create:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>the first set of data</td>
          <td>sub info</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>the second set of data</td>
          <td>sub info</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
    <td>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>the third set of data</td>
          <td>sub info</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>the fourth set of data</td>
          <td>sub info</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>I used the border around the complete table to emphasize the distinction between the two
  tables that are nested within the main table. These two tables contain two types of data within each row.</p>

<hr>

<p>CSS Syntax</p>

<p>selector {property: value;</p>

<p>Selector - is the WHO, the tag or selector you want to change</p>

<p>Property - is the WHAT, what do you want to change. For example, is it the background color, the font, etc.</p>

<p>Value - is the HOW, how do you want to change the property. For example, do you want the font bigger, what color do
  you want the background, etc.</p>

<p>Pseudo-classes, such as ':hover' or ':visited', can't seem to be used with ID selectors. You have to use CLASS
  selectors in order for them to work properly.</p>

<p>Added a Favicon icon at the top my page to look like my logo. I created and downloaded it at favicon.cc. Once I had
  what I liked I added it to the folder of my
  site and added a &ltlink&gt tag to implement the icon at the top. I changed the 'rel' attribute to "icon" as well.
