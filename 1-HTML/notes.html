<h1>◀ HTML ▶</h1>

<h1>this is a level one heading using the "h1" tag</h1>
<h2>this is a level two heading using the "h2" tag</h2>
<h3>this is a level three heading using the "h3" tag</h3>
<h4>this is a level four heading using the "h4" tag</h4>
<h5>this is a level five heading using the "h5" tag</h5>
<h6>this is a level six heading using the "h6" tag</h6>

<p>&ltbr&gt tag is used to create line breaks in between html elements.</p>

<p>&lthr&gt tag is used for header rows, this creates simple line borders.</p>

<p>HTML attributes are used to modify the HTML elements, for example, you could
  change color, size, etc. These are placed just after the starting HTML tag and
  between the tag type and the greater than symbol.</p>

<!-- this is a comment in html -->

<p>&lt!DOCTYPE&gt tells the browser which version of HTML we are using</p>

<p>The &lthead&gt tag holds information about the page and tells the browser how
  it should handle the page.</p>

<p>The &lttitle&gt tag tells the title of the particular page.</p>

<p>The &ltmeta&gt tag gives extra meta data or associated data to the document</p>

<p>The "charset='utf-8'" is an attribute that tells the browser that anything
  written in the body is encoded using the 'UTF-8' encoding system. 'UTF-8' is the
  standard encoding when working with HTML5. The reason for using this encoding system
  is because it uses all of the international symbols including other characters such as
  emojis.</p>


when using an &ltul&gt (unordered) or &ltol&gt (ordered list) and you're looking to add additional information to
the &ltli&gt list items, you could nest those items. In order to nest the items, you would have
to include an additional &ltul&gt or &ltol&gt tag after your list item and before your closing tag.
An example would be:<br>
<pre>
&ltul&gt

  &ltli&gtFirst example
    &ltul&gt
      &ltli&gt sub info on first example&lt/li&gt
    &lt/ul&gt
  &lt/li&gt

&lt/ul&gt
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>First Example
    <ul>
      <li>sub info on first example</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Example
    <ul>
      <li>sub info on this example</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<br>

When using tables you can create two columns of data within a table by nesting tables.
The tables can be nested within the table data tags. For example:
<pre>
  <code>
    &lttable&gt

      &lttr&gt

        &lttd&gt

          &lttable&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the first set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the second set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

          &lt/table&gt

        &lt/td&gt

        &lttd&gt

          &lttable&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the third set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the fourth set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

          &lt/table&gt

        &lt/td&gt

      &lt/tr&gt

    &lt/table&gt
  </code>
</pre>

this example would create:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>the first set of data</td>
          <td>sub info</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>the second set of data</td>
          <td>sub info</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
    <td>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>the third set of data</td>
          <td>sub info</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>the fourth set of data</td>
          <td>sub info</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>I used the border around the complete table to emphasize the distinction between the two
  tables that are nested within the main table. These two tables contain two types of data within each row.</p>

<h1>◀ CSS ▶</h1>

<h3>CSS Syntax</h3>

<p>selector {property: value;</p>

<p>Selector - is the WHO, the tag or selector you want to change</p>

<p>Property - is the WHAT, what do you want to change. For example, is it the background color, the font, etc.</p>

<p>Value - is the HOW, how do you want to change the property. For example, do you want the font bigger, what color do
  you want the background, etc.</p>

<p>Pseudo-classes, such as ':hover' or ':visited', can't seem to be used with ID selectors. You have to use CLASS
  selectors in order for them to work properly.</p>

<p>Added a Favicon icon at the top my page to look like my logo. I created and downloaded it at favicon.cc. Once I had
  what I liked I added it to the folder of my
  site and added a &ltlink&gt tag to implement the icon at the top. I changed the 'rel' attribute to "icon" as well.
</p>

<h3>Div</h3>

<p>The purpose of the div is to work with CSS. The div, or content divison element, is a container to divide and
  structure your content.</p>

<p>If you add content to a div, the height of the div will change default to the height of the content.</p>

<h3>Box-Model</h3>

<p>In the challenge, I was tasked to make three boxes, each with a width and height of 200 pixles. The idea was to make
  the boxes touch from edge to edge. The body of the page had a margin and padding of zero, to allow each element to
  touch the side of the page. From there, I gave the first element a border of 10 pixles and padding of 20 pixels.
  Next, I added up each side plus the width of the box, 200 + 40 (the 20 pixels of padding on each side) + 20 (the 10
  pixels of the
  border on each side) = 260 pixels. Using this calculation, I was about give my next box (middle box) a margin on the
  left of
  260 pixels. This margin pushed the middle box right to the exact edge of the first box (top box). Then, for the
  middle box, I was
  ask to add a border of 20 pixels. Next, I added up the sides of the border this time. 200 (for the width) + 40 (for
  the sides of the border) + 260 (for the margin-left) = 500 pixels. I was then able to use that calculation for the
  next boxes margin on the left, lining it up perfect with the edge of the middle box. The last, or bottom box, was
  given a border of 10 pixels. If I wanted to make another box I would just account for the width + the width of the
  border or padding (if I had any) + the pixels for the margin-left. This formula would give me the exact edge for my
  next box if I chose to do another one.
</p>

<p>the &ltspan&gt element is an inline element and only takes up as much space as the content. &ltspan&gt, &ltimg&gt,
  and &lta&gt tags are common inline elements. The elements typically appear next to each other because they are not
  block elements. When using an inline element, you will find that it won't comply to a change of with if you were
  wanting to style those elements. So, when using an inline element, you could change the display attribute in the css
  to block. This would allow you to change the width of the element to whatever you want. However, unfortunately, each
  element would occupy its own line. This is may be something to I would want to achieve in some instances, however
  there is a better way to display both inline elements and block elements to get the best of both worlds and that's
  inline-block. Inline-block allows the elements to sit side by side and also allows you to change other attributes,
  such as wis</p>

<h1>◀ Design School ▶</h1>

<p>Analogous Color: these are colors that are usually adjacent or next to one another. An example would be Red and
  Orange. This type of color palette is harmonious and easy to look at for the user. This is good for creating
  background screens or the main interface.</p>

<p>Complementary Colors: These colors are opposite of each other on the color wheel. For example, Red and Green or Blue
  and Orange. This color palette is great at grabbing attention, so you would want to use it sparingly. This palette is
  great for logo design or screen shots for marketing apps.</p>

<p>Split Colors: This color palette consist of three colors. Usually you would pick a color, such as red, and instead
  of using the opposite color you would use the analogous colors of the the complementary color. This breaks up the
  stark contrast and is a little easier on the eyes for the user while bringing attention to the logo. This is
  definitely great for icons or logos.</p>
