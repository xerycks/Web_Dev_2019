  <h1>◀ HTML ▶</h1>

  <h1>this is a level one heading using the "h1" tag</h1>
  <h2>this is a level two heading using the "h2" tag</h2>
  <h3>this is a level three heading using the "h3" tag</h3>
  <h4>this is a level four heading using the "h4" tag</h4>
  <h5>this is a level five heading using the "h5" tag</h5>
  <h6>this is a level six heading using the "h6" tag</h6>

  <p>&ltbr&gt tag is used to create line breaks in between html elements.</p>

  <p>&lthr&gt tag is used for header rows, this creates simple line borders.</p>

  <p>HTML attributes are used to modify the HTML elements, for example, you could
    change color, size, etc. These are placed just after the starting HTML tag and
    between the tag type and the greater than symbol.</p>

  <!-- this is a comment in html -->

  <p>&lt!DOCTYPE&gt tells the browser which version of HTML we are using</p>

  <p>The &lthead&gt tag holds information about the page and tells the browser how
    it should handle the page.</p>

  <p>The &lttitle&gt tag tells the title of the particular page.</p>

  <p>The &ltmeta&gt tag gives extra meta data or associated data to the document</p>

  <p>The "charset='utf-8'" is an attribute that tells the browser that anything
    written in the body is encoded using the 'UTF-8' encoding system. 'UTF-8' is the
    standard encoding when working with HTML5. The reason for using this encoding system
    is because it uses all of the international symbols including other characters such as
    emojis.</p>


  when using an &ltul&gt (unordered) or &ltol&gt (ordered list) and you're looking to add additional information to
  the &ltli&gt list items, you could nest those items. In order to nest the items, you would have
  to include an additional &ltul&gt or &ltol&gt tag after your list item and before your closing tag.
  An example would be:<br>
  <pre>
    <code>
      &ltul&gt

        &ltli&gtFirst example
          &ltul&gt
            &ltli&gt sub info on first example&lt/li&gt
          &lt/ul&gt
        &lt/li&gt

      &lt/ul&gt
    </code>
</pre>
  <ul>
    <li>First Example
      <ul>
        <li>sub info on first example</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Example
      <ul>
        <li>sub info on this example</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <br>

  When using tables you can create two columns of data within a table by nesting tables.
  The tables can be nested within the table data tags. For example:
  <pre>
  <code>
    &lttable&gt

      &lttr&gt

        &lttd&gt

          &lttable&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the first set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the second set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

          &lt/table&gt

        &lt/td&gt

        &lttd&gt

          &lttable&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the third set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

            &lttr&gt

              &lttd&gt the fourth set of data &lt/td&gt

              &lttd&gt sub info &lt/td&gt

            &lt/tr&gt

          &lt/table&gt

        &lt/td&gt

      &lt/tr&gt

    &lt/table&gt
  </code>
</pre>

  this example would create:

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>the first set of data</td>
            <td>sub info</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>the second set of data</td>
            <td>sub info</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
      <td>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>the third set of data</td>
            <td>sub info</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>the fourth set of data</td>
            <td>sub info</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>I used the border around the complete table to emphasize the distinction between the two
    tables that are nested within the main table. These two tables contain two types of data within each row.</p>

  <hr>

  <h1>◀ CSS ▶</h1>

  <h3>CSS Syntax</h3>

  <p>selector {property: value;}</p>

  <p>Selector - is the WHO, the tag or selector you want to change</p>

  <p>Property - is the WHAT, what do you want to change. For example, is it the background color, the font, etc.</p>

  <p>Value - is the HOW, how do you want to change the property. For example, do you want the font bigger, what color
    do
    you want the background, etc.</p>

  <p>Pseudo-classes, such as ':hover' or ':visited', can't seem to be used with ID selectors. You have to use CLASS
    selectors in order for them to work properly.</p>

  <p>Added a Favicon icon at the top my page to look like my logo. I created and downloaded it at favicon.cc. Once I
    had
    what I liked I added it to the folder of my
    site and added a &ltlink&gt tag to implement the icon at the top. I changed the 'rel' attribute to "icon" as well.
  </p>

  <h3>Div</h3>

  <p>The purpose of the div is to work with CSS. The div, or content divison element, is a container to divide and
    structure your content.</p>

  <p>If you add content to a div, the height of the div will change default to the height of the content.</p>

  <h3>Box-Model</h3>

  <p>In the challenge, I was tasked to make three boxes, each with a width and height of 200 pixles. The idea was to
    make
    the boxes touch from edge to edge. The body of the page had a margin and padding of zero, to allow each element to
    touch the side of the page. From there, I gave the first element a border of 10 pixles and padding of 20 pixels.
    Next, I added up each side plus the width of the box, 200 + 40 (the 20 pixels of padding on each side) + 20 (the 10
    pixels of the
    border on each side) = 260 pixels. Using this calculation, I was about give my next box (middle box) a margin on
    the
    left of
    260 pixels. This margin pushed the middle box right to the exact edge of the first box (top box). Then, for the
    middle box, I was
    ask to add a border of 20 pixels. Next, I added up the sides of the border this time. 200 (for the width) + 40 (for
    the sides of the border) + 260 (for the margin-left) = 500 pixels. I was then able to use that calculation for the
    next boxes margin on the left, lining it up perfect with the edge of the middle box. The last, or bottom box, was
    given a border of 10 pixels. If I wanted to make another box I would just account for the width + the width of the
    border or padding (if I had any) + the pixels for the margin-left. This formula would give me the exact edge for my
    next box if I chose to do another one.
  </p>

  <p>the &ltspan&gt element is an inline element and only takes up as much space as the content. &ltspan&gt, &ltimg&gt,
    and &lta&gt tags are common inline elements. The elements typically appear next to each other because they are not
    block elements. When using an inline element, you will find that it won't comply to a change of with if you were
    wanting to style those elements. So, when using an inline element, you could change the display attribute in the
    css
    to block. This would allow you to change the width of the element to whatever you want. However, unfortunately,
    each
    element would occupy its own line. This is may be something to I would want to achieve in some instances, however
    there is a better way to display both inline elements and block elements to get the best of both worlds and that's
    inline-block. Inline-block allows the elements to sit side by side and also allows you to change other attributes,
    such as wis</p>

  <h3>Static and Relative positioning</h3>

  <p>By default, the children always sit on top of the parent. For an example, you have a &ltdiv&gt element and
    anything added to that element, say an &lth1&gt, would sit on top of the &ltdiv&gt. The parent element would only
    cover the child element otherwise.</p>

  <p>With positioning, the original box model sits inside of the positioning box. This dicates how the adding to the
    margin and / or padding.</p>

  <p><strong>Static Positioning</strong> - Just keeps to the default position. When you have elements in the static
    position the element will keep with the standard flow of the page.</p>

  <p><strong>Relative Positioning</strong> - puts the element in a position relative to the default position. Two
    important things to remember when using relative positioning. One, the element will not effect anything else on
    screen. The element flow is left in tact in relation to other elements on the page. Two, the side you're moving is
    going to move relative to that side. For example, if you're moving 50 pixels from the top, its going to push the
    element down 50 pixels from the top of the element to the top of the position the element was originally in. This
    is because of the box model around the element.</p>

  <p><strong>Absolute Positioning</strong> - moves the element relative to the parent element. For example, if you had
    a picture inside of a div element, and you were to position the picture with an absolute position, moving it right
    any amount of pixels would be relative to the div element. Also, using absolute positioning takes the element out
    of the flow of the document.</p>

  <h1>◀ Design School ▶</h1>

  <p><strong>Analogous Color</strong>: these are colors that are usually adjacent or next to one another. An example
    would be Red and
    Orange. This type of color palette is harmonious and easy to look at for the user. This is good for creating
    background screens or the main interface.</p>

  <p><strong>Complementary Colors</strong>: These colors are opposite of each other on the color wheel. For example,
    Red and Green or
    Blue
    and Orange. This color palette is great at grabbing attention, so you would want to use it sparingly. This palette
    is
    great for logo design or screen shots for marketing apps.</p>

  <p><strong>Split Colors</strong>: This color palette consist of three colors. Usually you would pick a color, such as
    red, and instead
    of using the opposite color you would use the analogous colors of the the complementary color. This breaks up the
    stark contrast and is a little easier on the eyes for the user while bringing attention to the logo. This is
    definitely great for icons or logos.</p>

  <p><strong>Triadic Color</strong>: This is when you pick a color on the wheel and then essentailly make a triangle.
    An example of this
    would be yellow, blue, and red. This palete is well balanced and attention grabbing. However, this color palette
    was
    using heavily in the 90's, so the palette is a bit dated.</p>

  <p><strong>Monochromatic</strong>: is taking the same color and blending it with either white or black to give you
    various shades or
    saturations. This is a color palette is very popular right now.</p>

  <h3>Typography</h3>

  <p><strong>Serif</strong>: this are a more traditional type of font. This type of font usually has those little edges
    on the ends.
    Historically, those sharp edges exist from stone masons who would carve out letters and usually needed the relief
    from the chisel in order to properly display the letters. There are four major classes in the serif family:
    <ul>
      <li>Old Style</li>
      <ul>
        <li>These were popular around the 15th to 18th century.</li>
        <li>Examples would include: Caslon, Garamond, Palatino</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Transitional</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A mixture between Old Style and Modern</li>
        <li>Examples would include: Times New Roman, Georgia, Bakersville</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Modern</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Usually seen of having various thickness between lines</li>
        <li>Great for headlines</li>
        <li>Examples would include: Didot, Bodoni, Elephant</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Slab-serif</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Created for newspaper printing</li>
        <li>used to be legible on poor quality paper</li>
        <li>Examples would include: American Typewriter, Courier, Roboto</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><strong>San-serif</strong>: They are usually reconized by not having the edges that you find on serif fonts.
    They're usually a litte more rounded or flat on the edges of the typeface. A slightly more modern typeface. There
    are
    four major classes in the san-serif family:
    <ul>
      <li>Grotesque</li>
      <ul>
        <li>popular in the early 19th and 20th century</li>
        <li>Examples would include: News Gothic, Franklin Gothic, Monotype Grotesque</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Neo-Grotesque</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The newer variation on the Grotesque typeface</li>
        <li>Examples would include: Helvetica, Univers, Folio</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Humanist</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Takes inspiration from serif fonts</li>
        <li>some typefaces may have modulation (different thickness between lines)</li>
        <li>Examples would include: Gill sans, Johnston, Syntax</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Geometric</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Near perfect circles and squares</li>
        <li>originated in Germany in the 1920s</li>
        <li>Examples would include: Kabel, Nobel, Metro</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Good Practice in Interaction Design</h3>
  <p>a good rule of thumb is that light always comes from above. You want to use any effects, such as box shadows, to
    come underneath the subject. The shadows give the user a little more of a realistic interaction. In turn, the user
    is more likely to click on a button that looks and behaves like a real button. When designing, you wanna make sure
    you're asking if this seems intuitive, does this seem like its clickable, does the seem like it has some dimension?</p>
